# Reporting a Fault

Please send fault reports with the system to the Commodore and the Boatswain.

In the fault report please include:

* A description of the error including, if possible, what data values are faulty.  
  * For example, Depth is showing "---" on the TackTick display, but is present on the plotter display.  Reports such as speed is wrong, without
* a description of what is happening are difficult to remotely diagnose.
  * Screenshots, photos, videos etc. are always helpful!
* The date and time that the error occurred.

The Commodore and Boatswain have remote access to the system, so they may ask you to leave it switched on when you're doing something else.
