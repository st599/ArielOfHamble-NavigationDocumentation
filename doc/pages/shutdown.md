# Shutting Down the Navigation System

1. The TackTick Instruments are shut off by switching off one unit, the others receive a command to shut down.

2. Turn off the VHF Switch on the Switch Panel.

3. The preferred way of switching off the navigation is to request the Raspberry Pi mini computer to shut down.  To do this, first click on the Raspberry logo in the top left of the screen.

4. Then click "Shut Down".

> NOTE: DO NOT just switch off the Battery Isolator - this could corrupt the data on the Raspberry Pi mini computer.
