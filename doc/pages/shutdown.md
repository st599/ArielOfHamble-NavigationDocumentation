# Switching Off the Navigation System

1. The TackTick Instruments are shut off by switching off one unit, the others receive a command to shut down.

2. Turn off the VHF Switch on the Switch Panel.

3. The preferred way of switching off the navigation is to request the Rspberry Pi mini computer to shut down.  To do this, first click on the Raspberry logo in the top left of the screen.

4. Then click "Shut Down".

> NOTE: If the navigation switch is turned off before a shut down is requested, the additional MacArthur HAT board attached to the Raspberry Pi will immediately request a shutdown of the system.  This can take up to a minute.  Please wait at least 2 mins before switching off the Battery Isolator.

> NOTE: DO NOT just switch off the Battery Isolator - this could corrupt the data on the Raspberry Pi mini computer.
