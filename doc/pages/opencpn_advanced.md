# Advanced Use of OpenCPN



## Updating Charts

_This should only be done with permission of the commodore or boatswain_  This action can be undertaken remotely by them, which is preferable.

To update charts in the Open CPN plotter, click on the settings icon (a cog) in the left hand side dropdown.  This will open the following menu system.

1. Within the Options box, clci the charts icon in the top row, then on the second row of options that appears, click "o-charts".

2. This will open up the "o-charts" options.  Click "Refresh Charts List" and wait for the plotter to check the Internet server for any updates.

3. Click on the first chart set (in this image "British Isles 2025").  If there is a chart update available, under the available actions you will be able to click "Update Selected Chart for sgl001F361B (USB Key Dongle)"

4. The software will then update a chart pack update from the internet.  This will take some time.

6. Repeat steps 3 - 5 for the other chart packs installed in the system (in the image we also have "France Atlantic 2025")

## Connecting to Navigation Data via WiFi

A data connection can be established with the plotter to receive data on a mobile device.

Data available on the connection includes:

* Location
* Speed and SOG
* Heading and COG
* Depth
* AIS vessels
* Waypoint data (range, bearing etc.)
* DSC Emergency message locations

The WiFi access point has a 5G mobile data connection to allow the plotter to download chart updates, weather data and tidal data and to allow remote access.  It is not to be used for generic web browsing. *PLEASE ENSURE YOU DISCONNECT FROM THE WIFI BEFORE BROWSING THE WEB*
